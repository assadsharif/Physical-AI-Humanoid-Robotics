## Content Placeholder

*This chapter is under development.*

The content will cover:
- Whole-Body Control Overview
- Task-Priority Frameworks
- Quadratic Programming Formulation
- Constraint Handling (Joint limits, Collisions)
- Operational Space Control
- Multi-Task Coordination
- Real-Time Implementation Considerations

---

:::warning Safety Note
Whole-body control involves simultaneous control of many degrees of freedom. Ensure joint limits and collision constraints are always enforced.
