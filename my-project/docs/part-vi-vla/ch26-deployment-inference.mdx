## Content Placeholder

*This chapter is under development.*

The content will cover:
- VLA Inference Requirements
- Latency Analysis for Robot Control
- Model Optimization (Quantization, Pruning, Distillation)
- Edge vs. Cloud Deployment Tradeoffs
- Hardware Considerations (GPUs, TPUs, Edge Accelerators)
- Inference Pipelines for Humanoids
- Monitoring and Updating Deployed Models
