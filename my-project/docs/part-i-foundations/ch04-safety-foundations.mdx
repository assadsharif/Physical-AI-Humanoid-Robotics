:::danger Critical Safety Information
This chapter provides educational content about safety principles. It does NOT constitute safety certification training. Always consult qualified safety engineers and relevant regulatory bodies when designing real robotic systems.
:::

:::warning Simulation vs. Reality
Behaviors that appear safe in simulation may be dangerous on real hardware. Never assume simulation results transfer directly to physical systems without thorough real-world validation.
