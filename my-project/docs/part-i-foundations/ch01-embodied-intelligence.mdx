## Content Placeholder

*This chapter is under development.*

The content will cover:
- What is Embodied Intelligence?
- The Embodiment Hypothesis
- Sensorimotor Coupling and Cognition
- From Symbolic AI to Embodied AI
- Implications for Humanoid Robot Design

---

## Key Concepts

- **Embodied Cognition**: The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world
- **Sensorimotor Loop**: The continuous cycle of sensing, processing, and acting
- **Morphological Computation**: How body shape and dynamics contribute to information processing

:::warning Safety Note
When studying embodied intelligence concepts, remember that physical robots operate in the real world where actions have consequences. Always consider safety implications when translating theoretical concepts to physical implementations.
