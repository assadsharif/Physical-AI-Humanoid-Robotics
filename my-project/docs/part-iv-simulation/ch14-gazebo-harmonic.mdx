- World Creation and Environments
- Performance Optimization

---

:::warning Simulation vs. Reality
Gazebo physics, while sophisticated, does not perfectly replicate real-world dynamics. Contact behavior, friction, and compliant interactions require careful tuning and validation against physical hardware.
