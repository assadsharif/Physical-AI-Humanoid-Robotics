# Chapter 11: Quality of Service and Reliability

:::info Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Configure QoS policies for different humanoid subsystems
- Understand reliability vs. best-effort communication tradeoffs
- Design QoS profiles for sensors, actuators, and planning
- Debug QoS compatibility issues
:::

:::note Prerequisites
- Chapter 9: ROS2 Architecture Deep Dive
- Understanding of networking concepts
:::

**Estimated Time**: 55 minutes
