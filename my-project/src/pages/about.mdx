# About This Textbook

## Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Foundations to Advanced Humanoid Control

This comprehensive textbook provides a complete learning path from the theoretical foundations of embodied intelligence to advanced humanoid control systems, covering modern simulation platforms and emerging Vision-Language-Action systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Part I: Foundations of Physical AI** - Core concepts of embodied intelligence, physical AI principles, and robotics mathematics
- **Part II: Humanoid Robot Fundamentals** - Kinematics, dynamics, actuation, sensing, and human-robot interaction
- **Part III: ROS2 for Humanoid Systems** - Architecture, lifecycle management, QoS, and reliability patterns
- **Part IV: Simulation Platforms** - Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and sim-to-real transfer
- **Part V: Advanced Humanoid Control** - Locomotion, whole-body control, manipulation, and perception
- **Part VI: Vision-Language-Action Systems** - Architecture, training, deployment, and safety

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Graduate students in robotics and AI
- Robotics engineers transitioning to humanoid systems
- Researchers exploring Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Practitioners working with ROS2 and simulation platforms

## Prerequisites

- Programming experience (Python or C++)
- Basic linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with general robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Safety First

Throughout this textbook, you'll encounter safety callouts highlighting potential hazards and best practices. Physical AI systems operate in the real world where actions have consequences. We emphasize safety-critical thinking from the very first chapter.
